        In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the
        smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with
        objective or practical meaning. In many languages, words also correspond
        to sequences of graphemes ("letters") in their standard writing systems
        that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space,
        or by other graphical conventions.[1] The concept of "word" is usually
        distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of
        word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own together
        or in other small words.
